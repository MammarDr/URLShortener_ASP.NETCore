1- DTOs are exposing Database fields
	I suggest changing names, "IsActvie": true => "active": true

2- Assigning plan to user has no indication on how long that subscription last.

3- DTO Validation is Happening Twice, one by Global ModelBinding and the other with Validation.

==== ApiLayer ===

1- JWT Http-only, how to revoke, if an admin jwt leaked how to revoke all admin jwt,

3- Users can't create URL because of permission
===  ====

1- separate Entity functions from FullDto functions

==== DataAccessLayer ===

Problems you have to not repeat:

1- each Entity must have its include children, GetUser(withPlan = true) ---Include--> Plan
2- Cancellation token implementation

==== Securit Ideas ===
1- Issue refresh token after token expires and if the old refresh token is used again, expire the tokens. one is the thief.
